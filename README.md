-  Welcome to my page. I am a student coder with the intent to focus on softwares in game coding, 3D design & HMI.
-  I’m currently learning basic java and have experience in basic HTML & CSS coding.
-  You can contact me at my email madamspringler@gmail.com or message me on my discord under the same user (@abandonedknowledge)
-  I am pronounfluid and use multiple neopronoun sets and prefer you ask my current sets, but the default is either hy/hym, shy/hyr or it/its.
-  Besides coding, I am also an artist and excel in creative writing and literature. You can find my art commissions @[] and my art instagram @abandonedknowledge
